                <h2>LICTON SPRINGS COMMUNITY COUNCIL</h2>
<p>Approved Minutes May 19 2021 6:30-8:00 P.M.</p>
<p><strong>Attendance Notes</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Online meeting by Zoom due to Coronavirus restrictions</li>
<li>Directors present: Melanie Davies, Mike Cuadra, Kathleen Braden, Liz Kearns, Bekah Gautrowski, Bob Blade, Lindsey Webb</li>
<li>Attendees: Dianne Trani, Janice Holkup, Ellen Beck, Danielle Rosenow</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Introductions, House-Keeping, and Reports from Visitors</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Melanie started the meeting and welcomed everyone at 6:35. </li>
<li>The minutes were approved. </li>
<li>Melanie asked for topics of discussion from attendees.</li>
<li>Janice Holkup shared information from Rep. Javier Valdez’ email newsletter outlining funding for the 46th district in the final state budget. This included $500,000 for the Aurora Commons acquisition, $150,000 to fund art by BIPOC artists at the Kraken training center, $30,519,000 for the North Seattle College library building renovation, $1,880,000 for library improvement grants, and $2,000,000 for the UW Medical Center NW behavioral health renovation.</li>
<li>Bob Blade talked about Aurora Reimagined, a new coalition that seeks to provide input in the city’s planning efforts around Highway 99. Melanie added that the city is at the conceptual level in planning right now and that it’s time to throw out broad, big ideas.</li>
<li>The treasurer’s report was approved.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Updates to ongoing committee and council work</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>LSCC BANK ISSUE: Liz talked about the issue of removing Jan Brucker as a signer for LSCC’s bank account at Verity since she is no longer part of the council. As treasurer, Liz said her priority is to have new signers who are easy to get in touch with. She noted the bank would need a copy of the minutes indicating who LSCC directors voted in as new signers, and then she could help initiate paperwork. The directors voted unanimously to approve a motion to remove Jan Brucker as a signer on the LSCC Verity checking account. There was some discussion about the appropriate number of new signers. The directors voted to approve a motion to allow four signers, the voted to add Lindsey Webb and Melanie Davies as signers on LSCC’s Verity checking account.</li>
<li>AURORA REIMAGINED COALITION: Melanie talked further about the Aurora Reimagined Coalition (website: www.got99problems.org) A large part of the city’s work on Aurora will be design guidelines related to pedestrian access, turn lanes, crossings, etc. The group meets once per month and will be holding revisioning workshops in July and August. Neighborhood residents can sign up on the website for updates. ALUV will likely be involved.</li>
<li>NORTHGATE LIGHT RAIL UPDATE: Melanie told the group that the pedestrian bridge between North Seattle College and the Northgate Link Light Rail station will be in place by the end of June. (Project link: http://www.seattle.gov/transportation/projects-and-programs/programs/bridges-stairs-and-other-structures/bridges/northgate-pedestrian-and-bicycle-bridge)</li>
<li>NORTH POLICE PRECINCT UPDATE: Melanie talked about a series of dialogues the Seattle Police Department North Precinct will be hosting. These will be an opportunity to talk more deeply about the police department and the community. Three dialogues will take place in each of the five precincts, including some in Licton Springs. Interested residents can sign up here: https://seattleux.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9BSU8pPfHcc0tRY</li>
<li>PRECINCT REPORT: Mike gave a precinct report. At the last meeting, hosts went over each new state law related to policing. Governor Inslee has signed all but two. One new law establishes a duty for officers to intervene and report. The hosts of the meeting talked about the encampment at the part being cleaned up. On the first Wednesday of the month, social workers went to the site to let people know they would need to leave. There had been some incidents that led to the decision to clear the park. Car theft and homicides are up recently in general, but crime is down locally. </li>
<li>BELLWEATHER HOUSING: Lindsey will be sending out a link to a survey Bellwether housing is conducting related to their future housing project and long house at North Seattle College. They are looking for community input on the project.</li>
<li>LISTSERV DISCUSSION: There was a discussion about outreach and information sharing via the listserv on the Licton Springs hotmail account. Attendees agreed that less is more when it comes to using the hotmail account for sharing information. However, there was some discussion about increasing outreach via social media like Facebook and Instagram. The directors voted to create a Licton Springs Instagram account. Lindsey volunteered to manage the account. She will also add Bekah as an admin on the Licton Springs Neighborhood account and remove Janice Lichtenwaldt.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Event Planning</strong>
- MUSIC IN THE PARK: There was a discussion about a music in the park event. Lindsey has been in email conversation with Boundless NW about an event over the summer. Dianne Trani asked about the cost of such an event. Lindsey said the council paid musicians ~$150 each for last year’s event.
- HALLOWEEN EVENTS: There was a discussion about a potential Halloween event but the topic was informally tabled as it’s several months away and the COVID-19 situation could be different then. Bob will get in touch with Casey at Epic Life Church for an update on what they’re doing.</p>

                <p><strong>LICTON SPRINGS COMMUNITY COUNCIL</strong></p>
<p>approved Minutes Jan. 27, 2021 6:30-8:30 P.M.</p>
<p>Online meeting by Zoom due to Corona virus restrictions</p>
<p>Directors present: Janice Lichtenwaldt, Lindsey Webb, Ellen Beck, Melanie Davies, and Kathleen Braden</p>
<p>Attendees: Dianne Trani, Mike Cuadra, Bekah and Matt Gautrowski, Osboldo Hernandez, Janice Holkup</p>
<p>Janice started the meeting at 6:35 and welcomed everyone.  </p>
<p>Minutes of Nov. 18, 2020 were approved as circulated.  Treasurer’s Report was approved and Ellen reported she filed our 990 form this month. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Board members: M/S/A to elect Bekah Gautrowski to fill the vacancy of Jan Brucker’s seat and Mike Cuadra to fill the vacancy of Tim Crosley’s seat.  According to the by-laws, this action places them on the Board immediately and then they agreed to be nominated for two-year seats with the March, 2021 meeting.</p>
<p>Kathleen updated regarding Board members and elections. The usual schedule has been interrupted due to the vagaries of the current COVID pandemic.  Here is the situation:</p>
<p>Terms up in April: Janice Lichtenwaldt, Kathleen Braden, Ellen Beck, Lindsey Webb. All have agreed to stay on the Board and be nominated at the March meeting for a two-year term. Liz Kearns and Melanie Davies have been continuing even though their terms were up earlier and will be also nominated for a new term at the March meeting but their terms should go until 2022, not 2023, because we are late in confirming them and it is better not to have the whole Board’s terms end simultaneously.</p>
<p>Ellen agreed to be nominated to continue as Treasurer; Kathleen is stepping down as Secretary and Lindsey agreed to be nominated for that position. Janice is completing her time as President (and everyone agreed she has done a wonderful job for us) and Melanie is interested in the nomination for that spot.  We will need a nomination for Vice-President and Mike Cuadra might be willing to serve.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other Duties: Kathleen has stepped down as administrator for the Licton Springs Facebook Page.  Janice is still an administrator and will add Lindsey as one. Janice will also look into management of our website where minutes are posted and coordinate with Bekah &amp; Matt who may be willing to help.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ad-hoc committee on by-laws revision: M/S/A to create an ad-hoc committee that Bekah will head up to consider revision to our by-laws and Lindsey will also help spearhead. She plans to start with input from the Council and then invite participation by people in the Licton Springs Community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Homelessness: Melanie led a discussion to update on issues of unhoused populations in the neighborhood. The group discussed City policy, presence of campers in the park and at Green Lake.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Parks: Liz Kearns sent in a note that work groups are being held in Mineral Springs and Licton Springs Parks, following proper protocols for pandemic safety.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Business members: The Board agreed to ask Liz to congratulate Pilgrim Coffee which has moved into the Starbucks space at Oak Tree and invite as a business member of LSCC and to have Kathleen due likewise with Salt Blade Meats</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Minutes by Kathleen Braden, Secretary</p>
<p>Next meeting Feb 17 (Melanie will chair)</p>
