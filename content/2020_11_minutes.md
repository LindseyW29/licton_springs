1. Issues of interest from Visitors: Jenny Frankl of SPU Clean Cities Litter Abatement shared information on litter route for Licton Springs. (attached).  Liz noted a work party upcoming Dec. 12 for Licton Springs Park with volnteers from Blanchet H.S.

If the RPZ is expanded (there is an existing one due to NSCollege) with upcoming transportation changes, cost is $65/year for two year cycle.  Low income people have an option of paying $10.

3. Jenny discussed the litter abatement program that started in 2017 in the city and in 2018 in Licton Springs-Aurora area.  A contractor is paid to cover Aurora between 84th and 105th.  Parks Dept deals with parks so that is not part of their program.  The volume of calls has not increased, but the volume of litter picked up has. The public cans along Aurora havea four times/week pick up for garbage and three times per week for recycling. Tracy suggested using free form at bottom of Find It Fix It app for special pickups for neighbors who voluntarily pick up litter.

4. Board elections for 2021 were discussed. Our usual schedule for elections had been postponed last spring due to pandemic.  Nominations are due in March.  Let Kathleen know if Board members are interested in serving again.  She will construct a recruitment statement for Dianne Trani from jet City Apts. to sed to residents to try to get representaiton from renters in neighborhood.  Everyone wil try to recruit people, with an eye toward more divesity.
