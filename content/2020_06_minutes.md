**LICTON SPRINGS COMMUNITY COUNCIL**

Meeting Date/Time: June 19, 2020 6:30-8:30 P.M.

These meeting minutes were approved at the July 2020 meeting.

Online meeting by Zoom due to Corona virus restrictions

Directors present: Janice Lichtenwaldt, Liz Kearns, Lindsey Webb, Melanie Davies, Ellen Beck, and Kathleen Braden

Attendees: Susan Ward, Janice Holkup, Mike Cuadra, Mehul Shah, Dianne Trani, Sharon Bruce

Janice started the meeting at 6:35 and welcomed everyone.

At our invitation, Susan ward of ReVisioning Northgate, attended and updated LSCC on activities around the Northgate area and actions taken by RN. She noted it was formed at grassroots level to advocate for green spaces and livable spaces and includes representatives from various on-profits as well as residents and businesses. The group discussed transportation issues, the underpass beneath I-5 at Northgate, METRO and its projects, including bus staging areas, parking impacts with impending light rail station, affordable housing, the tree code. The current pandemic has limited in-person meetings for the organization but it has been active in submitting commentary and letters.

Minutes of May 20, 2020 were approved as distributed. The treasurer’s report through was approved.

The group then turned to having an activity that is community-oriented. Janice noted we were informed that while our arts in the Park project was on hold due to pandemic, the City did allocate $1600 to LSCC for any culture-related activity in the neighborhood, particularly promoting diversity and justice and combatting bias. Janice shared the email and offered by email and at the meeting a set of ideas on how to use the funds. (attachment) Janice will check with our partners at Clear Sky, Dianne train offered to look into musicians, and Melanie suggested we do tee-shirts. Lindsey and Janice will do some organizing on a possible event in August. The date of August 19 seemed most likely.

It was agreed we would touch base on whether to have a Board retreat in the fall, similar to the one we had Sept. of 2019.

The group then discussed the issue of recruiting a more diverse Board membership. Kathleen noted data from 2010 census that indicated Licton Springs is one of the more ethnically and racially diverse neighborhoods north of the ship canal. (attachment) The group discussed the current climate for change, given local and national issues. Mehul weighed in about the need to do outreach to people who are not homeowners, perhaps leaving flyers near apartment buildings. Janice will provide the information about the local renters she met who were doing volunteer clean-up. Lindsey and Mehul offered to do a draft of a recruiting tool poster. Janice offered to write up a statement that could be posted on our web site and Facebook page. Kathleen, who is also a block watch captain, will contact North precinct officer David Gordo to see if there are any special instructions for people neighboring the precinct building and send it along to the Board if she receives any information.

Notes by Kathleen Braden, secretary.

Next meeting July 15 by Zoom

ATTACHMENTS

Email from Janice June 12, 2020 to the Board:

We are receiving $1,600 to do something for the neighborhood to uplift residents by providing creative, artistic, and/or cultural content. The requirements seem very loose. Given these funds were was originally ear-marked to celebrate the sacred indigenous status of Licton Springs I’d love to put some of the funds toward that AND we can do anything. Below is the start of a brainstorming list. Any other ideas? 



*   	Hire local artists to paint mail boxes in the neighborhood.  \
 	
*   	Develop, record, and host a podcast series, in partnership Clear 	Sky, to celebrate the LS designation \
 	
*   	Buy colored chalk for the neighborhood to create their own sidewalk 	murals. Take pictures and post on our Facebook and Instagram pages 	and the blog \
 	
*   	Hiring local artists to make chalk murals around the neighborhood \
 	
*   	Hiring musicians to perform and stroll through the neighborhood on 	different nights throughout the summer - bagpipes, saxophone, 	trumpet, accordion, banjo, guitar \

Dear Arts in Parks Partner,

 

Thank you so much for your patience during these difficult and challenging times for our communities.  The work that many of you continue to do to support your community through all of this has been truly inspiring.  While we are no longer able to fund your originally proposed project in full, we are looking forward to working with you to support the work you are doing that benefits our community.  Seattle needs arts and culture now more than ever. We need you and the role you play in our sector’s ecosystem and in the civic life of our City as a whole. Even if the way you carry out your work has shifted, the value you provide cannot be underestimated. 

 

**AWARD AMOUNT**

The attached invoice is for $1,600 to support a public benefit in lieu of your original project and funding amount.

 

**HERE’S ALL YOU NEED TO DO:      **

**Respond **to this email to confirm that you have received it and with a brief description of the action or project that will take the place of your originally funded event and provides artistic or cultural public benefit (please see the backside of the attached invoice-report form for suggestions).

This should be an action or project that is in the spirit of and supports the goals of the Arts in Parks program, of supporting under resourced communities within Seattle and supports the efforts of **[Seattle Together](https://seattletogether.org/)**which include:



*   	**Uplift residents by providing creative, artistic, and cultural 	content** (digital and analog) to residents, especially 	vulnerable populations, by resourcing artists, organizers and other 	cultural partners.  \
 	
*   	**Elevate, support, and uplift mutual aid efforts** for 	community resilience, efficacy and recovery driven by a dynamic 	understanding of racial equity, neighborhood-level and cultural 	community relationships, and digital technology access.   \
 	
*   	**Combatting bias/hate speech/harassment/violence** amidst 	Covid-19, with an awareness of how this could have impacts on 	surveillance and policing practices disproportionately impacting 	BIPOC communities. \


 

Small-scale projects are fine and if it aligns with work that you were planning on doing to benefit your community, even better. It can be something done via an email, online, virtually, through social media, or any other method of distribution that aligns with public health guidance for physical distancing. We’re not looking for you to spend significant time making something happen. We are hoping the prompts will inspire your imagination, be forward thinking and accessible.  At this time, these funds should not be planned to go towards a postponed in-person park event.  

We ask that whatever action or project you do, to please include the tag #SeattleTogether and the City of Seattle logo found here: [http://www.seattle.gov/arts/about-us/download-our-logo#tabs-5](http://www.seattle.gov/arts/about-us/download-our-logo) or provide written credit. (For example: “This project was supported by Arts in Parks, a partnership with Seattle Parks and Recreation and the Seattle Office of Arts & Culture.”)

 

**Complete** an action that provides artistic or cultural public benefit.  Please email a link and/or promotional item/information about your project at least a week prior to it taking place so that we can help share it out. 

 

**Submit your invoice and report**. Once your project is complete and available to the public, complete the attached invoice form and email it to <span style="text-decoration:underline;">jenny.crooks@seattle.gov</span> along with your brief narrative report. Please include a link of where to access your project or attach with your invoice.

               We do need your signature on the form. If you don’t have a printer/scanner, you can save the invoice form as a pdf and use the attached instructions to sign it electronically.

You may invoice anytime in 2020 through November 30, 2020 but we highly recommend doing so before **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">August 31, 2020</span>**. 

Once received, the City will send you payment. On average it can take 4 weeks for you to receive payment.

 

 **Keep us posted if either your primary contact or authorized signer changes**.
