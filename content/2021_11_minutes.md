### Welcome, Introductions, and Hearing from Neighbors

- Melanie started the meeting and welcomed everyone at 6:35. Attendees introduced themselves.
- Shaun Vinyard moved to Licton Springs from Wedgwood and wants to get more familiar with issues in the Licton Springs neighborhood.
- Evelyn Lemon asked whether a psychiatric hospital is being built in the neighborhood? Bekah shared that a private company is building a senior inpatient and family center. Melanie shared that there is supportive services and housing at 96th and Aurora. Shaun shared that UW is building an inpatient psychiatric hospital currently and thinks it will be a great addition to mental health care in the greater Seattle area.
- Janice Holkup noted that apartments are going to be demolished across from the playfield near the school.

### Licton Springs Park

- In her capacity as park steward at Licton Springs Park, Liz gave an update on the park. 300 plants were recently delivered and the volunteer team can use all the help they can get in placing/planting them. There are work parties going on every month. [LW note: those meetings are noted on the calendar on the LSCC website]. 
- Regarding the comfort station (restrooms), Liz said there was an insurance investigator there one day when she was at the park and a Seattle Parks & Recreation employee unlocked the fence. Both said the fire was the result of arson. The city’s insurance was for $200,000 and that may end up being the cost to rebuild.
- Liz asked the insurance investigator and the Parks & Rec employee if they could save anything from the building. However, the fire was so intense that it compromised the integrity of the metal so the answer was no. Liz said it would be nice to be able to store tools in the new structure but for $200,000 it might be difficult. 
- Melanie suggested that Parks & Rec staff may be looking for additional funds for the structure. She volunteered to write a letter to Parks (with Liz’s help) outlining how the facility has been used and what we would like. Mike said it never hurts to get letters of support, and maybe it would be a good avenue to get tribal support. Kathleen talked about the Muckleshoot tribe’s charitable fund and how the council could apply for $5,000 from that fund for educational signage for when the facility gets rebuilt.

### Halloween Recap

- Bekah said the Halloween decorating raffle and neighborhood map were very well received across the neighborhood and there were many participants. The digital map was viewed 2,776 times. There was a motion to approve $45 from the LSCC account to cover part of the raffle prize that were not donated. The motion passed.

### North Precinct Meeting

- Mike Cuadra gave a summary of the last North Precinct meeting. Nicole Macri of the Downtown Emergency Service Center talked about emergency services. DESC recently purchased two hotels to provide permanent supportive housing services. Lindsey asked about whethere P2P meth had ever been discussed at these meetings and whether it’s been part of the homelessness issue in Seattle. Mike said it has been discussed and it is a problem here.

### Arts in the Park Funding

- Lindsey talked about the open funding opportunity for Arts in the Park funding and suggested partnering with Boundless NW on an event next summer. She said she would submit an application for funding for a neighborhood concert and would get in touch with Rob from Boundless NW to discuss.

### Art Selection Committee

- LSCC has the opportunity to nominate someone on the art selection committee for the fire station on Meridian. There was a motion to nominate Bekah Gautrowski and the motion passed.

### By-Laws Committee

- There was a discussion about how the council forms the agenda and how that should be reflected in the by-laws. Directors also discussed allowing a consent agenda (there was wide approval) and what constitutes appropriate notice for upcoming meetings.
