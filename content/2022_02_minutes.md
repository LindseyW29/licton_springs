### Welcome and Introductions

- Melanie started the meeting and welcomed everyone at 6:32. Attendees introduced themselves.

### Hearing from Neighbors & Guests

- Oliver Bazinet gave an update on the City of Seattle’s plans to rebuild the comfort station at Licton Springs Park. 
  - A senior architect is working on a permit package for demolition, which should be submitted this week. There will be an appointment for permit intake within 8-12 weeks, maybe sooner.
  - The city will partially demolish the restroom portion and leave the storage room in the back. The facility is in an environmentally critical area and if it’s fully demolished, the city may not be able to build it again where it is.
  - Demo work will hopefully happen in May or June, potentially sooner. 
  - Parks & Rec has identified funding for planning and design of a replacement. Non-gender specific restrooms and specialized locking mechanisms will be part of the project. The full project will probably take a couple of years. 
  - Mike asked about a budget for art. Oliver said that 1% for art funding is usually for new projects but this project may have access to Parks & Rec funding for art. Community would hopefully be involved in selection.
  - Meeting attendees shared thoughts on priorities for the project, including accessibility and safety (for children especially), acknowledgment of the significance of the site to Native American communities, storage of tools used by volunteers who help maintain the park, and durable trash cans.
  - Anyone with questions/comment can direct them to Oliver at oliver.bazinet@seattle.gov
- Osbaldo Hernandez came to reconnect with the group and provide a couple of updates.
  - Mayor Harrell is changing the way his administration does outreach and community engagement. Osbaldo will let us know when plans are final.
  - There will be new programs with public safety in mind.
  - Osbaldo has been working with the Aurora Reimagined Coalition, SDOT, and King County Metro on preparing for the study on north Aurora.
  - Melanie was interested in how the new mayor will be reaching out to diverse communities and helping neighborhood associations do that as well. None of the previous planning has reached the community. Osbaldo will keep us updated.
- Lindsey encouraged everyone to complete the City of Seattle’s survey about recreation and community gathering space needs in the neighborhood. Survey here: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/AuroraLictonSprings

### Approval of Minutes & Treasurer's Report

- There was a motion to approve the minutes from the January 19 meeting. The motion passed.
- Lindsey noted incorrect dates on the Treasurer’s report. There was a motion to approve the Treasurer’s Report with revisions. The motion passed.

### By-Laws Committee
- Bekah gave an overview of the by-laws committee’s process in proposing revisions and explained the goals of today’s discussion and vote.
- Kathleen asked whether adoption would change the elections coming up this spring. Bekah said the revised by-laws won’t change that. There was a discussion about straightening out director terms.
- Melanie moved to approve the proposed by-laws. Bob seconded the motion. All board members voted for the motion as well as LSCC members Janice, Kevin, Brooke, and Mary. The motion passed.
- In response to a follow-up question from Mike, Bekah said that there is no legal requirement to have dues. Additionally, we are allowed to change our by-laws as we see fit and we do not need to file them with the state.

### Other Issues
- After the last meeting, Kathleen drafted a letter reconnecting with Councilmember Debra Juarez following her election as President of the City Council but didn’t get approval. There was a discussion about the letter she drafted. She finalized it and emailed it to Councilmember Juarez’s office.
- Lindsey asked Mike if it’s possible to have a representative from the North Precinct at the May meeting. Mike will reach out to ask about availability.
- Bekah noted that the March meeting is the one where director nominations will happen, so everyone should bring a friend who’s interested in getting involved. 
- There was a short discussion about the history of efforts to build a community center in Licton Springs. Melanie talked about ALUV’s work on this prior to the pandemic. 

### Adjournment
- Melanie adjourned the meeting at 7:34pm.
